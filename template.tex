\documentclass[12pt,chapterheads]{ucsd}
% documentclass options: default is 11pt, oneside, final.
% fonts: 10pt, 11pt, 12pt -- are valid for UCSD dissertations.
% sides: oneside, twoside -- note that two-sided theses are not accepted by OGS
% mode: draft, final -- draft mode switches to single spacing, removes hyperlinks,
%                       and places a black box at every overfull hbox (check these before submission).
% chapterheads -- include this if you want your chapters to read:
% Chapter 1
% Title of Chapter
%
% instead of
%
% 1 Title of Chapter


% Include all packages you need here.  Some standard options are suggested below.

% GEOMETRY - This will force the use of Letter paper.
% Many TeX installations default to A4 paper.  The formatting
% of the thesis class file requires Letter, else the margins
% will be wrong when you go to print it (and OGS will complain).
% If your TeX implementation is not setup for Letter paper, and
% you cannot change it, uncommenting the following line may fix 
% problem.
\usepackage[paper=letterpaper]{geometry}

\usepackage{todonotes} %gzb
\usepackage{subcaption} %gzb
%\usepackage{titlesec}
\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}% Include \subsubsection in ToC

\usepackage[toc,page]{appendix}

%% AMS PACKAGES - Chances are you will want some or all of these if writing a math dissertation.
\usepackage{amsmath, amscd, amssymb, amsthm}

%% GRAPHICX - This is the standard package for including graphics for latex/pdflatex.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%I tend to use double quotes the "traditional way"
\usepackage [english]{babel}
\usepackage [autostyle, english = american]{csquotes}
\MakeOuterQuote{"}

%\usepackage{caption}
%\usepackage{subcaption}

%% LATIN MODERN FONTS (replacements for Computer Modern)
% \usepackage{lmodern}
% \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%% INDEX
% Uncomment the following two lines to create an index: 
 \usepackage{makeidx}
 \makeindex
% You will need to uncomment the \printindex line near the
% bibliography to display the index.  Use the command
% \index{keyword} within the text to create an entry in the index
% for keyword.

%% HYPERLINKS
% To create a PDF with hyperlinks, you need to include the hyperref package.
% THIS HAS TO BE THE LAST PACKAGE INCLUDED!
% Note that the options plainpages=false and pdfpagelabels exist
% to fix indexing associated with having both (ii) and (2) as pages.
% Also, all links must be black according to OGS.
% See: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=hyperdupdest
% Note: This may not work correctly with all DVI viewers (i.e. Yap breaks).

%% DEDICATION
% You have three choices here:
%   1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.   Put in the text you want,
%   and you'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%   2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%   formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%   however you wish.
%
%   3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.

% \begin{dedication} % The style file will format this for you.
%   To two.
% \end{dedication}

% \begin{mydedication} % You are responsible for formatting here.
%   \vspace{1in}
%   \begin{flushleft}
% 	To me.
%   \end{flushleft}
%   
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{center}
% 	And you.
%   \end{center}
% 
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{flushright}
% 	Which equals us.
%   \end{flushright}
% \end{mydedication}

%% EPIGRAPH
%  The same choices that applied to the dedication apply here.

% \begin{epigraph} % The style file will position the text for you.
%   \emph{The music is in the making.}\\
%   ---Miller Puckette
% \end{epigraph}

% \begin{myepigraph} % You position the text yourself.
%   \vfil
%   \begin{center}
%     {\bf Think! It ain't illegal yet.}
% 
% 	\emph{---George Clinton}
%   \end{center}
% \end{myepigraph}

\tableofcontents
\listoffigures  % Uncomment if you have any figures
\listoftables   % Uncomment if you have any tables

%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
%  While technically optional, you probably have someone to thank.
%  Also, a paragraph acknowledging all coauthors and publishers (if
%  you have any) is required in the acknowledgements page and as the
%  last paragraph of text at the end of each respective chapter. See
%  the OGS Formatting Manual for more information.

\begin{acknowledgements} 
 Thanks for reading my answers.

%% VITA
%  A brief vita is required in a doctoral thesis. See the OGS
%  Formatting Manual for more information.

%% Abstract
% There does not seem to be a maximum length. From the OGS Formatting
% Manual: ``The abstract may continue on to a second page.''

%Edited the ucsd.cls file. Abstract becomes questions from committee.

\begin{abstract}

\textbf{Question one (Tom Erbe):} what spatial instruments/pieces already exist? How has spatial music developed in the last 30 years? Are any of these instruments FOSS/FOSH? Propose some systems that one might employ for real-time spatial sound synthesis. What is novel about these?

\par
\vspace{2mm}

\textbf{Question two (Tamara Smyth):} how does one go about recording/capturing spatial music using FOSS? What techniques exist for this? What are the limitations today of these recording technologies? What other documentation/formats/files does one need to create? Beyond recording, how does FOSS aid in the ability of computer music composers to have their works survive technological shifts (changes in OS, protocols, etc.)?  

\par
\vspace{2mm}

\textbf{Question three (Shahrokh Yadegari):} once a spatial work is created and recorded, what open XR technologies exist that one can leverage to present their works? What are the technical difficulties associated with this kind of work? What are the artistic difficulties associated with this kind of work? What are the differences between WebXR, MobileXR and HMDs (or related technologies like CAVEs)? Be able to talk about the visual system in relation to XR.
